# Meiosis-starter-flyd-react

[Meosis](https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis/wiki) basic setup

## Getting started

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/...
cd meiosis-starter-flyd-react
npm install
```

The `public/index.html` file contains a `<script src='bundle.js'>` tag, which means we need to create `public/bundle.js`. The `rollup.config.js` file tells Rollup how to create this bundle, starting with `src/main.js` and including all its dependencies, including [date-fns](https://date-fns.org).

`npm run build` builds the application to `public/bundle.js`, along with a sourcemap file for debugging.

`npm start` launches a server, using [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve). Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

`npm run watch` will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.

`npm run dev` will run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in parallel.
